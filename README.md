# Wordle Game


A wordle game created using Javascript, HTML, CSS. The word used in a particular instance is randomly generated from an API provided by Karimi Fatemi.
The game operates similarly to wordle by allowing a submission of four letters per attempt, a submission of four letters is enforced. Letters are highlighted in yellow if they are contained in the word, green if they are in the correct position, and gray if they are not contained in the word. Additional functionality includes a reset button that resets the board and word chosen, nightmode, an information section for the game, and a hint.
